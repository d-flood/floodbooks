    content: "David and Antoinette Flood’s _Anguish of Adolescence_ is a book that disrupts the world of Christian ministry, not just youth ministry, but the whole world of ministry, ministry of all kinds, in many places, of various titles. Flood’s stories, his sociological analysis, and his theological reflections manage to redescribe the world we all must enter who would become ministers of the gospel of Jesus Christ. With this book, David and Antoinette give us a new playbook for ministry"

    content: "For anyone who desires to share God’s love and good news with teens today, _The Anguish of Adolescence_ is invaluable in its insights and practical help. David and Antoinette Flood draw on their thirty years as bi-vocational youth leaders, plus extensive research on the cultural world of teens that includes skyrocketing numbers of teens suffering anxiety and depression. Teens often lack religious frameworks, and theological terms like \"gospel\" and \"peace\" have no biblical meaning. Offering an alternative to the superficial peace seen on social media, _The Anguish of Adolescence_ proclaims the everlasting gospel of peace and shows how this peace of God can be lived out among teens. For pastors and parents who want to connect better with their teens, this book provides a pathway to authentic, meaningful relationships."

    content: "It becomes evident that David and Antoinette have thoughtfully woven their research with years of rich experiences in youth ministry. It is this integration of biblical study, theological reflection, scientific research, and lived experience that commends _The Anguish of Adolescence_ as a worthy resource for those in youth ministry."

  - name: "Al Tizon, PhD"
    designation: "Executive minister of Serve Globally, and affiliate associate professor of missional and global leadership at North Park Theological Seminary"

    content: "Does theology really have something to say to adolescents who are trying to navigate faith in a troubling, rapidly changing world? According to David and Antoinette Flood’s _The Anguish of Adolescence_, the answer is a resounding Yes. Drawing upon a compelling theological understanding of the gospel of peace as revolutionary reconciliation, Flood demonstrates the power of the gospel to respond to adolescent angst over world events, church irrelevance, and the elusiveness of truth—in a word, anguish. Parents, youth pastors, and all who care about the welfare of Gen Z and younger generations need to read this book."
