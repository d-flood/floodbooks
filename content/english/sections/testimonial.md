    content: "David and Antoinette Flood’s _Anguish of Adolescence_ is a book that disrupts the world of Christian ministry, not just youth ministry, but the whole world of ministry, ministry of all kinds, in many places, of various titles. Flood’s stories, his sociological analysis, and his theological reflections manage to redescribe the world we all must enter who would become ministers of the gospel of Jesus Christ. With this book, David and Antoinette give us a new playbook for ministry"

    content: "Does theology really have something to say to adolescents who are trying to navigate faith in a troubling, rapidly changing world? According to David and Antoinette Flood’s _The Anguish of Adolescence_, the answer is a resounding Yes. Drawing upon a compelling theological understanding of the gospel of peace as revolutionary reconciliation, Flood demonstrates the power of the gospel to respond to adolescent angst over world events, church irrelevance, and the elusiveness of truth—in a word, anguish. Parents, youth pastors, and all who care about the welfare of Gen Z and younger generations need to read this book."
