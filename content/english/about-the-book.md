### About the Book

**_The Anguish of Adolescence_** is a timely read for anyone looking to understand and support today's teenagers, especially those grappling with anxiety, depression, and spiritual disconnect. As mental health issues surge, this highlights the importance of offering _the gospel of peace_ to emerging generations yearning for hope.

Teens face overwhelming pressures from social media and rapid cultural changes, often resulting in a growing disconnect from traditional family structures and religious institutions. This gap can be bridged by offering teens a pathway to reconnect with faith and family while addressing their struggles. 

Current research shows that _social media contagion amplifies external voices_, drawing youth into others' narratives and stripping them of their unique stories. Half of all teenagers struggle with anxiety and depression, and suicide attempts continue to rise.

Through a compassionate, incarnational approach, adults, youth ministers, and mentors are encouraged to connect with young people in their spaces—_building trust, listening, and learning their unique language_. Practical steps are provided to begin meaningful relationships, contextualize the gospel for young people, and offer real-world solutions to their struggles.

For those passionate about making a lasting impact in the lives of youth, **_The Anguish of Adolescence_** will equip you with the tools to break down barriers and foster deep, transformative relationships. Ultimately, it’s about offering healing, wholeness, and the love of Jesus to a _generation that desperately needs and yearns for peace but rejects the church_. This resource is for anyone committed to walking with teens through their spiritual and emotional journeys.
